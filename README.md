## What I’m Learning

- 🔹 Mastering the CLI — making daily tasks quicker and easier
- 🔹 Grasping the “why” — developing a holistic understanding, not just memorization
- 🔹 Hands-on practice with interactive tasks and real-world scenarios
- 🔹 Package management and application in Linux
- 🔹 Looping, scripting, API, and automation with Bash
- 🔹 File permissions, processes, users, storage, mounting, and much more

## 🚀 My Goal

To become proficient in Linux administration and scripting — and to use these skills to grow and contribute to my future career in technology.
